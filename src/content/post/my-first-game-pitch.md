In the spirit of [exploring game design](/posts/exploring-game-design/) while studying it at [SAE](https://www.sae.edu/grc/courses/game-design-certificate/), I just did my first pitch deck for my upcoming game, Cosmic Jack!
This pitch was done exclusively for educational purposes but I did my best and wanted to share.

You can find it [here](https://pitch.cosmic-jack.com).
