# Future of Web Development

In my opinion, web development, and Front-End in particular, has been having an identity crisis for the last 10-13 years. Frameworks as well as patterns come and go, and while most of us are still trying to catch up, the tide seems to constantly rise.

I'm not going to correlate tech stacks in this article or try to guess which framework is going to survive. My gut call is that **no framework** is going to and I'll explain why.

## Speculating

Thinking about what is technology and what I've been doing for the last 6-7 years I've been feeling quite negative about the future. I speculate that layoffs will not stop and the need for web developers **will slowly decline up to 80-90% of what's in demand today up until 2030**. I know it's a bold statement, hear me out.

Most of us web developers are requested to create CRUD APIs that read/write to databases and Forms/Tables for submitting/reading data from those sources. And, to be honest, I don't think these things _are that much complex anymore_. These are issues thousands of developers are solving the same issues in parallel as we speak, with little to no deviation in terms of requirements. Yes, the schema of the data changes and the interactions in a Front End app might change, but the essence of reading and writing data has been mostly the same since the 90s. Furthermore, considering how technology usually evolves in any society, repetitive tasks that many people do in parallel tend to be the ones that technology tends to erase as time progresses. This of course has to do with AI, since it seems that is the piece of technology that's going to change how we interact in the upcoming years. I'm not saying that AI will come for our jobs. I'm saying that whether AI does come or not, I think it's highly unlikely that web development requirements will stay in the above form - Forms, Tables, Databases and CRUD APIs.

## Hope for the future

I'm not advising anyone to change their field of study or abandon web development as a career path. I think this advice is absurd. To back this up I'm also doing web development boot camps for people that have no idea what web development is and want to pick it up as a career.
I'm advising anyone to build upon strong foundations and challenge themselves constantly from both technical and communication standpoints.
When in doubt, return to the basics. The web will need that know the platform and not simply _some tooling_.
