## Manuscript

My main point is that participating in what we call web development SHOULD be all about the democratization of information. Many of us spent many many years developing software for enterprises, loosing the point of what the real value of the web, to most people.

Enterprise software is important, for the enterprises and their products. However, those products are oriented towards profit, in the arena of web. However, the real value of the web lies in its ease of access, and it's undiscriminating ease of access. I believe we should spend more time on those areas, rather than empowering huge enterprise profit.

I don't think it's reasonable for the plethora of people to work for enterprise profit value, rather than the immediate impact on society. I understand that this is a tough topic to tackle, and it's not obvious to measure the society impact of a project, even an enterprise one. But I feel that we focus on enterprise profitability more than we should.

It seems to me that most people work for enterprises exclusively because it's a good paying field, with a relative safety. Most people that I know of do not seem to enjoy this kind of work and it's been rumored quite a bit that those companies kill creativity and inspiration for employees.

However, making a living is a priority. Some of us are privileged enough to have the advantage of being able to think on how we can spend our time and our efforts creating something of value, WHILE getting paid.

What is weird is that, if you observe the culture around us, most influencers and entrepreneurs are pretty consistent about "doing what you love" and "trying to creating something of value" as the de facto ways of succeeding. That, of course, is directed towards individuals that have found a way to make a living and, in addition, have an environment that allows them to grow.

What I want to come down to is that I believe we do not foster an environment of contribution well enough. We do not have societies of equal opportunities and many people do not have the chance to get creative and do what fulfills them. I consider this a waste and I feel like the side effects of this waste are enormous. I cannot fathom the rate of progress if we had an environment were more people could use their talents.

So, coming back to the web, I think the web is an environment in which is easier to provide equality of opportunity. I learnt how to program and make a living out of the generosity of the web. And as with people that created this environment, I feel that I have to contribute in improving it, and not just work on enterprise software because "it pays well".

The conversation is deeper, it a systemic asset to it and it seems very interesting to me. My conclusion is that we should not prioritize monetary profit that does not adhere to value, but rather than prioritizing actual social value over business profit. This system occasionally aligns business profit and social value, but that's not always case.
