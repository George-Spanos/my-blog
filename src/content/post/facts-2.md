## Terminology

I characterize **audacity** as the behavior in which someone seems to speak in a way that might seem arrogant when perceived from a certain standpoint. The keyword here for me is **arrogance**. It seems to me that being audacious correlates with the perception of arrogance. We usually use the term audacity with a positive load, in contrast to, what I'll consider, its counterpart - arrogance. In my journey so far, I've come to believe that showcasing a little bit of audacity goes a long way.
