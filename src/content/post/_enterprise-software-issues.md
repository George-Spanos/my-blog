1. Huge budgets on development efforts that span accross mutliple years.
2. Communication inefficiencies that immensly decrease individual productivity.
3. A sense of meaningless urgency.
4. Compromising software cohesion for the sake of closing contracts, avoiding price penalties.
5. As a result of 1 and 2, there's an increased amount of tolerance to developer incompetence, due to overflowing budgets. -->
