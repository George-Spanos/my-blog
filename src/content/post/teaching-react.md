## Foreword

I've been teaching for 12 years. Teaching was never my primary job. It was my primary income as a student and it was the only "job" I managed to do as a student without hating myself. Others included working at cafes, phone sales, tech support etc.

After jumping into programming I started teaching again naturally. I studied math so programming was not new to me but it was something I had to teach myself to get to a professional level. I remember helping quite a bunch of people over the years - people needing help with job assessments, help to build up a stronger feel for a specific tool that I happened to be accustomed to, or even help to get a grasp of some math behind programming on a deeper level.

So math and programming. This is what I've been teaching.

## Web Development Bootcamp

After doing this for quite some time I decided to give it some structure. I thought that since people seek my advice often, maybe I could structure this knowledge and provide a boot camp for people who want to get into software from non-related fields of study.

My first set of students were 3 friends who wanted to leave their jobs for something better. After all tech jobs pay better than the average job out there. I was very glad when my friends could not attend the boot camp after 6 months in because **they got a full-time job**!

## Bootcamp Curriculum

Before reflecting on teaching React, I want to give a brief overview of the course curriculum up to teaching React so that you know what foundation my students had up to that point of the course:

1. **Web Basics** - Clients, Servers, Network
2. **Basics of Computer Science** - CPU, Memory, Programming Languages
3. **Modern Web Technologies and Patterns**. - Frameworks and Tooling, Security, Cryptography, System Abstraction
4. **Basic programming with JavaScript** - Language Runtimes, VMs, Compling vs Scripting
5. **Front End** - Browser and playing with the DOM API
6. **Front End Frameworks** - React
7. **Git** - Souce-control whats and whys
8. **Backend** - Server, Database, SQL, Monitoring, Testing, ExpressJS
9. **Databases with PostgreSQL**
10. **Production** - Packaging, Deploying, Monitoring, Profiling, Tracing

This is not an exhaustive list and I'm not giving enough intel on each bullet because that would make this article huge. The point I'm trying to make is that in no way do my students see React as a first interaction with code. They should be familiar with the basic ideas of programming and software and specifically have played with the DOM API quite a lot.

## Teaching React

On this specific curriculum, people seem to be baffled by React almost immediately. To them, the DOM API seems a lot simpler even though it has a ton more boilerplate for the same stuff. It's also not declarative which is by default more intuitive since computers are imperative machines at heart. Considering that what they've learned so far is pure programming and concepts, the imperative is closer than the declarative paradigm.
