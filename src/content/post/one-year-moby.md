## Intro

The 3rd of February, 2024 marked my first year owning a bootstrapped software company, Moby IT. I will lay down what I've learned so far, mostly let it out and maybe spark some thoughts on my readers.

## Financials

During this first year, I generated revenue exclusively by **outsourcing**. I staffed enterprise teams, and did mostly front-end work, as usual. While this is not the path that I hope my company will take, it's what pays the bills for the time being, while I'm trying to give flesh to a greater plan.

I started my company with a rudimentary amount of 3.000 € because I had clients who were going to pay me right out of the gate.

In 2023, I generated a revenue of around 47.000 € and my expenses were about 40.000 €.
_My salary is included in the expenses._

## Lessons Learned

1. Understanding marketing is very important. And when we're speaking about the survival of a newfound company, they are more important than technical proficiency and excellence.
2. There's a considerable amount of time to be spent on creating a sales network. Learn where your clients reside and how to speak to them.
3. Have a way to teach new colleagues how to work. Most people have a different taste of what professionalism means. Be ready to teach people about what you need and have patience while doing so.
4. Narrowing your target audience and being specific is one of the most important actions when approaching marketing.
5. Refine your Value Proposition. Be confident about it. Many companies can do the job. Probably better than you. So, why you?
6. Be consistent. Show up. Write about what you do. Get the word out. It's never wasted time if you truly believe what you do.
7. Software Quality is a problem beyond a certain scope. Coming from the perspective of an engineer, it was eye-opening to realize that if you're a new company, you are considered lucky to have technical debt. Most others have gone bankrupt.

Finally, I've understood that a software engineer has to train himself to become an entrepreneur. It's a toolset of skills that you have to cultivate. Having created and delivered 200 enterprise software projects means little to nothing when you're trying to get an idea out.
